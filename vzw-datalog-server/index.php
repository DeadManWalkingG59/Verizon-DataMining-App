            <h6 class="subheader">The application will work in two different ways: automatically sending information in a given time frame (ie. every 12 hours) or manually by clicking on an User Interface (UI) element. Customers will be able to manually input their emails address for further support and a message detailing the problem they’re having from the convenience of their android device. Additionally, the application with proper permission from the costumer will be able to send to Verizon Wireless’ server helpful information such as: signal strength, location, memory usage and installed applications. After that information is in a database it could be exported to a Microsoft Excel document and useful for presentations and finding correlations between the data.</h6>
