Verizon Data Mining App
===================================

This repo contains the source code of my first research school project. It was more development that actual research because we just had to implement an idea. I worked with a team of 4 people. At the root of this repo is a poster and a Power Point presentation I presented in my school's IAP (Industries Affiliated Program).

Two main things were developed here:
* An Android Application located in the 'vzw-datalog' folder. Android Apps are in Java and XML.
* A Server App located in the 'vzw-datalog-server' folder. The Server had a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySql and PHP).
